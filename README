This main directory contain the following subpackages of the APRON project:

num:
	manipulating "generic" numbers (used by intervals,
        newpolka and possibly octagons).

itv:
	extension of num, manipulating also linear expressions.

apron:
	apron interface, C version

newpolka:
	convex polyhedra library

octagons:
	octagon library

box:
	interval library

ppl:
	wrapper to call the Parma Polyhedra Library from APRON (C & OCaml)
	requires PPL 0.9 and GMPXX
	not compiled unless HAS_PPL is defined in Makefile.config

mlgmpidl:
	OCaml interface for the GMP and MPFR libraries, used by mlapronidl.
	Requires GMP version 4.2 or up, MPFR 2.2 or up.

mlapronidl:
	apron interface, OCaml version (require apron)

Makefile.config.model:
	common configuration file model (to be copied to Makefile.config)
	(installation directories mainly)

Makefile:
	compiles as many things as it can

	make all (C + OCaml version if HAS_OCAML)
	make c (C version)
	make ml (OCaml stuff)
	make doc (not useful for a normal user)
	make clean (clean things, with the exception of generated files)
	make mostlyclean (clean all it can clean, implies clean)
	make rebuild (build generated files, mainly for OCaml interface)
	make distclean (clean the distribution directories)
	make install (installs in directories specified in Makefile.config)

Minimal Requirements:
	c: GMP, MPFR
	ml: OCaml, CamlIDL
	doc: latex, dvipdf, makeinfo, texi2html, texi2dvi
	rebuild: GNU sed, GNU m4
