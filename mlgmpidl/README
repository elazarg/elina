# This file is part of the MLGmpIDL OCaml interface for GMP, released under
# LGPL license.

# Please read the COPYING file packaged in the distribution

This package is an OCAML interface for GMP library.

The interface is decomposed into 5 modules:
Mpz       : multiprecision integers
Mpzf      : multiprecision integers, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Mpq       : multiprecision rationals
Mpqf      : multiprecision rationals, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Gmp_random: random numbers generation

Compared to the well-known MLGMP interface developped by D. Monniaux
(http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/programmes.html.en), MLGMPIDL favours an
imperative interface to a functional interface (all functions are offered in an
imperative version, more efficient in term of memory allocation). Moreover, it
uses CamlIDL, which allows to design easily further OCaml/C interface that
needs GMP types, using "import mpz.idl" clauses. The APRON project exploits
this.


REQUIREMENTS
============
GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)

INSTALLATION
============

1. Library
----------
Set the file Makefile.config to your own setting.
You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

type 'make', and then 'make install'

The OCaml part of the library is named gmp.cma (.cmxa, .a)
The C part of the library is named libgmp_caml.a (libgmp_caml_debug.a)
'make nstall' installs not only .mli, .cmi, but also .idl files.

2. Interpreter and toplevel
---------------------------

You may also generate runtime and toplevel with
'make gmprun', 'make gmptop'

3. Documentation
----------------

The documentation (currently very sketchy) is generated with ocamldoc.

'make mlgmpidl.dvi'
'make html' (put the HTML files in the html subdirectoy)

4. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.
