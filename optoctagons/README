OptOctagons
An Optimized Library for the Octagon Abstract Domain

Requirements:
  Make sure you have latest version of APRON library installed. The APRON library can be downloaded from
    http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/
  
To install our "optoctagons" Library:
	Go to the "apron/optoctagons" directory in terminal
		1. Check if your machine supports SSE or AVX as follows:
			a. Run "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "sse\|avx"".
			b. Check for strings "sse", "avx" in output.
		2. To compile the library: 
			a. If your computer supports AVX run "make IS_VECTOR=-DVECTOR" to compile the source. This will use AVX vectorized operators for dense type.
			b. Else if your computer supports SSE run "make IS_VECTOR=-DVECTOR IS_SSE=-DSSE" to compile the source. This will use SSE vectorized operators for dense type.
			c. Else run "make". This will use scalar operators for dense type.
		3. Run "sudo make install" to install the library.
    
How to Use in Static Analyzer

  Java:
	
      Copy the files in "java_interface" directory into APRON_PATH/japron/apron
      Replace the Makefile in APRON_PATH/japron directory with the Makefile in "java_interface" directory.
      run "make" in the APRON_PATH/japron
      run "sudo make install" to install the updated "libjapron.so" file.
      Initialize the APRON Manager as:
        man = new OptOctagon();
      
  C++:
      
      Copy the files in "C++ interface" directory into APRON_PATH/apronxx
      Replace the Makefile in APRON_PATH/apronxx directory with the Makefile in "C++ interface" directory.
      run "make" in the APRON_PATH/japron
      run "sudo make install" to install the updated "libjapron.so" file.
      Initialize the APRON Manager as:
        man = new opt_oct_manager();
