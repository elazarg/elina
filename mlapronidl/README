This package is an OCAML interface for the APRON library/interface.

The interface is decomposed into 15 modules, corresponding to C modules:
Scalar     : scalars (numbers)     
Interval   : intervals on scalars 
Coeff      : coefficients (either scalars or intervals)
Dimension  : dimensions and related operations
Linexpr0   : (interval) linear expressions, level 0
Lincons0   : (interval) linear constraints, level 0
Generator0 : generators, level 0
Manager    : managers
Abstract0: : abstract values, level 0
Var        : variables 
Environment: environment binding variables to dimensions
Linexpr1   : (interval) linear expressions, level 1
Lincons1   : interval) linear constraints, level 1
Generator1 : generators, level 1
Abstract1  : abstract values, level 1

By default, variables (Var.t) are implemented as strings. To
change this, one need to manually replace the default file var.ml
by a user-defined one. The module Environment ensures that the new
Var module offers a compatible signature.

REQUIREMENTS
============
M4 preprocessor (standard on any UNIX system)
APRON library
GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
mlgmpidl package
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)

INSTALLATION
============

1. Library
----------
Set the file Makefile.config to your own setting.
You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

type 'make', and then 'make install'

The OCaml part of the library is named apron.cma (.cmxa, .a)
The C part of the library is named libapron_caml.a (libapron_caml_debug.a)

'make install' installs not only .mli, .cmi, but also .idl files.

2. Documentation
----------------

The documentation (currently very sketchy) is generated with ocamldoc.

'make mlgmpidl.dvi'
'make html' (put the HTML files in the html subdirectoy)

3. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour.
