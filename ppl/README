This package is a wrapper for the the Parma Polyhedra Library.

Requirements:
- APRON
- PPL library version 0.9, with gmp support
- for ppl_test: NewPolka APRON module

What are provided:
- a manager to access the C_Polyhedron and NCC_Polyhedron classes
- C++ exceptions are mapped back to APRON exceptions
- flag_exact and flag_best are correcty sets
- all the widenings are available through the algorithm parameter
- functions not availble in PPL are emulated (e.g., _array and _parallel 
  functions)
- a unit testing program ppl_test for regression testing; it works by
  comparing the result of PPL and NewPolka on random polyhedra

Limitations:
- no support for intervals in linear expressions and constraints
- no support for other domains in PPL (Grid, BD_Shape)
- integer dimensions are abstracted as real ones; the functions will set
  flag_exact and flag_best to top whenever intdim>0
- only PPL 0.9 was tested, other PPL version might not work
