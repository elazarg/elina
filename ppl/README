This package is a wrapper for the the Parma Polyhedra Library.

Requirements:
- APRON
- PPL library version 0.9, with GMP support
- GMPXX (normally installed with GMP)
- for apron_ppl_test: NewPolka APRON module

What are provided:
- a manager to access the C_Polyhedron and NCC_Polyhedron classes
- C++ exceptions are mapped back to APRON exceptions
- flag_exact and flag_best are correcty sets
- all the widenings are available through the algorithm parameter
- functions not availble in PPL are emulated (e.g., _array and _parallel 
  functions)
- a unit testing program apron_ppl_test for regression testing; it works by
  comparing the result of PPL and NewPolka on random polyhedra

Limitations:
- no support for other domains in PPL (Grid, BD_Shape)
- integer dimensions are abstracted as real ones; the functions will set
  flag_exact and flag_best to top whenever intdim>0
- only PPL 0.9 was tested, other PPL version might not work

How to install:
- setup in ../Makefile.config (PPL_PREFIX, APRON_PPL_PREFIX)
- compile and optionally install APRON with NewPolka
- make         => C libary
- make ml      => OCaml library
- make install => install C and (if compiled) OCaml libraries
