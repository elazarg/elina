This package is a wrapper for the the Parma Polyhedra Library.
(http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/)

Requirements:
- APRON
- ITV
- PPL library version 0.9, with GMP support
- GMPXX (normally installed with GMP)
- for apron_ppl_test: NewPolka APRON module

If HAS_PPL is defined in ../Makefile.config, then the main APRON Makefile
will automatically build and install this module.


IMPORTANT

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   PPL 0.9 misses Grid_Generator::coefficient and must be patched

   please apply ppl.patch against PPL 0.9 as follows:

   1. go to the directoy containing the ppl-0.9 directory
   2. type 'patch -p0 <PREFIX/apron/ppl/ppl.patch'
   and then compile ppl

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


What is provided:
- a manager to access the C_Polyhedron and NCC_Polyhedron classes
- a manager to access the Grid class
- C++ exceptions are mapped back to APRON exceptions
- flag_exact and flag_best are correcty sets
- all the widenings are available through the algorithm parameter
- functions not availble in PPL are emulated (e.g., _array and _parallel 
  functions)
- a unit testing program apron_ppl_test for regression testing; it works by
  comparing the result of PPL and NewPolka on random polyhedra

Limitations:
- Polyhedra and grids are experimental but tested
- semantics of assign and subst on grids with integer variables is not
  fully aggreed upon and may change
- no support for other domains in PPL (BD_Shape, Powerset)
- only PPL 0.9 was tested, other PPL version might not work
- not implemented: fprintfdiff, (de)serialize_raw
- precision could be improved for:
  . sat_lincons

How to install:
- setup in ../Makefile.config (PPL_PREFIX, APRON_PPL_PREFIX)
- compile and optionally install APRON with NewPolka
- make         => C libary
- make ml      => OCaml library
- make install => install C and (if compiled) OCaml libraries
